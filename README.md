# K-means-Clustering
This project uses K-Means Clustering to group similar data points in an unlabeled dataset. It includes data preprocessing, optimal cluster selection (Elbow Method, Silhouette Score), model implementation, and visualization. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, itâ€™s great for learning unsupervised machine learning
