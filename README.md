# K-Means Clustering Project

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group similar data points. It explores **data preprocessing, optimal cluster selection, model implementation, and visualization** to extract meaningful patterns from an unlabeled dataset.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, normalization, and scaling.
- **Cluster Optimization**: Uses **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to find the best number of clusters.
- **Model Implementation**: Applies K-Means to group data into meaningful clusters.
- **Visualization**: Plots clusters with centroids for better interpretation.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🔧 Installation & Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kmeans-clustering.git
   cd kmeans-clustering
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 📊 Example Results
After running the clustering algorithm, you'll see visualizations such as **scatter plots with cluster centroids**, showing how the data is segmented into groups.
